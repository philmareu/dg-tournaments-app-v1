## DG Tournaments (2017)

In 2016, I build this project to view PDGA disc golf tournaments on a map. In addition to searching tournaments,it evolved into a robust tool to help tournament directors promote and provide information about their event. Then on Christmas Eve of 2018, the PDGA offered me a full-time position. I was beyond excited about this opportunity, but it did mean the end of this project. 

I put my time and love into this project and recently it has been bothering me while it sits in my private archives. So, since I have no plans to bring it back in its current form, I decided to share the original project and another version I updated to Laravel 11.

DG Tournaments was built it during a time when I was just starting to learn VueJS, writing tests (PHPUnit) and Laravel. It also touts quite a few integrations such as Stripe, Algolia, PDGA API and Foursquare. My skills have improved, and I've resisted the urge to refactor any piece of the code. So rough edges and all, here it is.
